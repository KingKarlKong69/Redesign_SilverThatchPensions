# Background Image Placement

Please place your background image (the teal/emerald coastal scene with palm leaves) in this directory with the filename:

**background.png**

The image path is referenced in `src/pages/Login.jsx` as:
```
/src/assets/images/background.png
```

## Recommended Image Specifications
